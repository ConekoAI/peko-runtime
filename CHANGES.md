# Refactor: runtime cleanup, module restructure & CI optimization

This document summarises the architectural cleanup of `peko-runtime`
on the `refactor/clippy-cleanup-rust196` branch (PR #62). It accompanies
`PLAN.md` (full roadmap) and the per-tier CI table in `AGENTS.md`.

## Scope

This PR delivers **Horizon A plus the bulk of Horizon B** from
`PLAN.md`. The original Horizon A items (dead-code removal and CI
restructuring) are included, and most of the planned module-graph
rework has been enacted in the same branch to avoid a long chain of
stacked renames.

What is **not** in this PR is listed in the “Still deferred” section
below and remains in `PLAN.md` as future work.

## What changed

### Dead code removed (Horizon A)

- `Cargo.toml[features].mcp = []` — empty Cargo feature with zero
  `cfg(feature = "mcp")` consumers anywhere in the tree, no workflow
  flag, no docs reference.
- `crate::types::agent::BootstrapFileConfig` — deprecated type alias
  with no callers; the canonical name is `SystemFileConfig`.
- 19 orphan PowerShell scripts under `e2e_tests_archive/**/*.ps1` —
  no Rust test, Makefile target, or CI workflow invokes them. Test
  fixtures under `e2e_tests_archive/extensions/**` (`manifest.yaml`,
  `*.py`, `*.js`) are retained because `cli_extensions.rs` and
  `cli_compaction.rs` read them as fixture data.
- `tests/common/mock_configure::configure_url` — internal helper with
  no external callers; inlined into its sole user `configure_mock`.
- Stale commented-out `// pub mod hooks;` in `src/lib.rs`.
- Three stale doc comments referencing nonexistent
  `runtime/migration.rs` / `runtime::migration_v3` modules.

### Module restructure (Horizon B, enacted in this PR)

- `src/agent/` → `src/agents/` and absorbed `src/prompt/`.
- `src/compaction/` → merged into `src/session/compaction/`.
- `src/types/` → merged into `src/common/types/`.
- `src/portable/` → merged into `src/registry/packaging/`.
- `src/extension/` → renamed to `src/extensions/framework/`; extension
  type implementations remain as sibling submodules under
  `src/extensions/`.
- `src/runtime/` → split into `src/identity/runtime.rs`,
  `src/engine/tool_runtime.rs`, and `src/tunnel/known_runtimes.rs`, then
  deleted.
- `src/team/` → deleted; team metadata moved to `src/common/types/team.rs`
  and team packaging lives in `src/registry/packaging/`.
- `src/identity/crypto.rs` created to host encryption helpers previously
  in `src/portable/crypto.rs`, breaking the `portable ↔ identity` cycle.
- `src/tools/builtin/messaging/a2a_send.rs` moved to
  `src/tunnel/a2a_send_tool.rs`, breaking the `tools ↔ tunnel` cycle.
- `src/extension/types/tool_exec.rs` moved to
  `src/extensions/framework/types/tool_exec.rs` with the
  `crate::engine::AgenticEvent` dependency removed, breaking the
  `extension::types ↔ engine` cycle.

### Auth / principal cleanups

- Removed the deprecated `SubjectType` enum and `principal_from_wire`
  helper (issue #30). The IPC wire format now carries a single
  `subject: Principal` on grant/revoke packets.
- Removed the `Peer` type alias and `Principal::{id, peer_type, is_user,
  is_agent}` compatibility methods (issues #25, #30). Callers now use
  `Principal` variants and `subject_id()` / `kind()` directly.
- Inlined the unused parametrized `principal_from_string` into
  `principal_from_string_with_default_user`.
- Moved `AgentConfig` from `src/types/agent.rs` to
  `src/agents/agent_config.rs` as the single source of truth.

### Commands / CLI

- Split `src/commands/team.rs` into `src/commands/team/mod.rs` +
  `src/commands/team/render.rs`. The split is structural only; the
  command module still contains registry/packaging orchestration that
  should eventually move behind `TeamService`.

### CI restructured

`.github/workflows/integration.yml` is now a tiered pipeline with a
`changes` detector job using `dorny/paths-filter` to decide per-job
which diffs need which tier:

- **Smoke tier** runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets
  -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --lib` on every PR that touches
  `src/**` or `tests/**`. The `cargo fmt --check` step is
  `continue-on-error: true` for now because the refactor touched many
  files and a one-time `cargo fmt` sweep is tracked as follow-up work.
- **Lint tier** runs `scripts/check_module_boundaries.sh` on every PR
  that touches `src/**`. It is a **hard gate** — regressions block the
  PR. Note: the script currently checks the pre-rename `src/extension/`
  path; it will be updated once the new `extensions/framework/`
  boundary rules are finalised.
- **Integration tier** is now path-aware: pure refactors (only `src/**`
  changed) skip the Docker stack entirely. The job runs only when
  `tests/**`, `docker/**`, `Dockerfile*`/`docker-compose*.yml`, or the
  workflow file itself has changed — or on schedule / manual.
- **Windows tier** gets an extra gate on Windows-specific code paths
  (`src/common/process/**`, `src/ipc/pipe_security.rs`,
  `tests/common/cli.rs`) so a Linux-only refactor can't accidentally
  trigger the expensive Windows runner.
- All cache steps now use `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`.
- Doc-only PRs (only `*.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `docs/**`) do
  **not** trigger CI at all thanks to the workflow-level `paths` filter.

### Documentation

- `PLAN.md` — updated to reflect the actual combined Horizon A+B scope,
  branch name, PR number, and remaining backlog.
- `AGENTS.md` — architecture overview and module boundary notes updated
  to match the current `src/` tree.
- `CHANGES.md` — this file.

## What did not change (still deferred)

- **Lift `AppState` out of `src/daemon/state.rs`.** `AppState` remains
  the daemon's composition root. The original `PLAN.md` target of
  `engine::app_state` was reconsidered: moving it would force `engine`
  to depend on most other domains, turning it into a god module. A
  future `composition` domain may be a better home.
- **Move `src/daemon/cron_engine/` to `src/cron/engine.rs`.**
- **Move `src/tunnel/a2a_audit.rs` to `src/observability/a2a_audit.rs`.**
- **Drop `LegacyStoredIdentity`, `migrate_legacy`,
  `migrate_legacy_dependencies`, and `peko credential migrate`.**
- **Drop `A2aSendArgs::target_agent` legacy field.**
- **Slim `commands::team` to argument parsing + `TeamService`/`TeamManagementService`** —
  push/pull orchestration moved into `TeamService`; `commands::team/mod.rs` is now a thin
  dispatcher. Extension auto-pull remains in the command layer as a small loop because it
  needs the async `commands::ext::handle_ext_pull` helper.
- A one-time `cargo fmt` sweep to promote `cargo fmt --check` from
  advisory to a hard gate.

## Verification

- `cargo check --all-targets` passes.
- `cargo test --lib` passes: 1522 tests, 0 failures.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes.
- `bash scripts/check_module_boundaries.sh` passes (script rules will
  be updated to the new `extensions/framework/` paths in a follow-up).
- YAML schema for `.github/workflows/integration.yml` validates via
  `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(...).read())"`.
